#pragma mark Writer Status
- (void)close;  // calls -flush, then releases most ivars such as _writer
- (void)flush;  // if there's anything waiting to be lazily written, forces it to write now. For subclasses to implement


#pragma mark Document
// e.g. docType of @"html" for HTML 5. KSHTMLWriter declares many such constants
- (void)startDocumentWithDocType:(NSString *)docType encoding:(NSStringEncoding)encoding;


#pragma mark Characters

//  Escapes the string and calls -writeString:. NOT intended for other text-like strings such as element attributes
- (void)writeCharacters:(NSString *)string;

#pragma mark Elements

- (void)writeElement:(NSString *)name content:(void (^)(void))content;

#pragma mark Current Element
/*  You can also gain finer-grained control over element attributes. KSXMLWriter maintains a list of attributes that will be applied when you *next* call one of the -startElement: methods. This has several advantages:
 *      - Attributes are written in exactly the order you specify
 *      - More efficient than building up a temporary dictionary object
 *      - Can sneak extra attributes in when using a convenience method (e.g. for HTML)
 *
 *  The stack is cleared for you each time an element starts, to save the trouble of manually managing that.

#pragma mark Whitespace
//  Writes a newline character and the tabs to match -indentationLevel. Normally newlines are automatically written for you; call this if you need an extra one.

#pragma mark CDATA
- (void)writeCDATAWithContentBlock:(void (^)(void))content;


#pragma mark Indentation
// Setting the indentation level does not write to the context in any way. It is up to methods that actually do some writing to respect the indent level. e.g. starting a new line should indent that line to match.

// Default implementation returns YES. Subclasses can override to advise that the writing of an element would result in invalid markup

#pragma mark Pre-Blocks Support
// Would be a category, but that confuses the compiler when looking for protocol-conformance in Sandvox

// These simple methods make up the bulk of element writing. You can start as many elements at a time as you like in order to nest them. Calling -endElement will automatically know the right close tag to write etc.
